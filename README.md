 ## Introduction

    I am Danielle Scott. I am an avid learner and a capable professional.  
    My background may not be a traditional STEM or more specifically tech background, but I have learned many transferable skills  
    over the years: discipline, organization, tenacity, and teamwork.  
    My current professional goals are to first, seek employment in Java Development to gain the necessary experience to jumpstart  
    my career in tech, and then second, to get experience to get into Data Science.
